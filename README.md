# List_Hashtable
## The Hashtable-class from .net namesapce Collections
The class mscorlib.System.Collections.HashTable translated for VB6.
The VBA.Collection already has hashing-capability but it is case-insensitiv, this means "a" and "A" will be the same key.
The HashTable-class is case sensitiv, so "a" and "A" will be treated as different keys.
